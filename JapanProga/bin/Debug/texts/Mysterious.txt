The Voynich Manustript.\ This strange book was discovered in 1912 in Frascati, near Rome, by Wilfred Voynich, an antique book collector.\ It's small, 25 by 18 cm, but thick, with 235 pages.\ The pages are illustrated with strange coloured pictures of different things, including unknown plants and herbs.\ The book uses a kind of writing which no one can understand.\ Some people think it's written in an unknown, secret language.\ Others think the whole manuscript must be a very complicated (and expensive) joke.\ No one knows for sure where it came from, but many experts believe it was made in Europe, sometime between the fifteenth and seventeenth centuries.\
